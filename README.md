# taskloan

TaskLoan is a service-as-a-collateral borrowing platform. TaskMasters create a TaskLoan, a loan a student may claim for 
which the repayment is in the form of services rendered, or just paying it back with interest.

There is a prevailing need for students to come up with money as the costs with regards to education are sometimes 
unexpected - projects, field trips, and miscellaneous fees. Our platform enables students to obtain that needed money
fast - without the necessary obligation of paying it back as cash. We liberalize the options for repayment, with 
convenience and ease of use as top priorities.
